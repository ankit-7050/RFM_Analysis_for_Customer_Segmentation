## Customer Segmentation:

> The majority of customers fall into the "At Risk/Need Attention" category (741 customers), followed by "Loyal Customers" (584), "Immediate Attention" (470), and "Top Customers" (418).
> This indicates that while a substantial portion of customers are at risk, there is also a loyal base that can be nurtured further.

## Customer Segment Percentage:

A large portion of the customer base requires attention, while loyal and top customers form a smaller but valuable segment.
Focusing on retention strategies for at-risk customers could be beneficial to improve overall engagement and reduce potential churn.

## Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value by Customer Segment:

Top Customers have significantly higher monetary value compared to other segments, suggesting that these are high-spending, valuable customers.
Loyal Customers have more consistent engagement, with moderate monetary values but high recency and frequency scores.
At Risk/Need Attention customers have low recency and frequency, indicating low engagement that may lead to churn if not addressed.

## Average Age & Income by Customer Segment:

Top Customers and Loyal Customers have a higher average income (77,290 and 63,837, respectively), suggesting that these segments might respond well to premium offerings or upsell opportunities.
Age demographics are fairly consistent across segments, though customers in the Immediate Attention category tend to be younger on average.

## RFM by Year:

Over the years, there seems to be an increase in Loyal and Top Customers, indicating positive growth in valuable customer segments.
This trend is positive, but maintaining and enhancing engagement strategies for these segments can continue this growth.

## Recency, Frequency & Monetary Value by Year:

The Monetary Value peaked in 2013 and decreased in 2014, signaling a possible dip in high-value purchases.
Ensuring consistent value for loyal and top customers could stabilize these metrics and prevent fluctuations.

## Recommendations:
Targeted Marketing: Implement re-engagement campaigns for the At Risk/Need Attention segment to rekindle interest and reduce churn.
Rewards Programs: Introduce loyalty rewards or exclusive offers for Top Customers and Loyal Customers to maintain their engagement and increase spending.
Segmented Offers: Tailor offers based on income and spending behaviorâ€”premium offerings for high-income segments (Loyal and Top Customers) and budget-friendly options for lower-income groups.
Retention Focus: Monitor the dip in monetary value in 2014 and work on strategies to stabilize and grow the spend per customer across all segments.
